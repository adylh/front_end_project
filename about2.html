              <strong>The beginning of graphic designing.</strong> My interest in graphic designing started a few years back, completely out of curiosity. Being an individual that loved creativity in all forms, I was always willing to test how creative I can get. So it initially began with short form content, particularly Tiktok. I was quite fond of the idea of utilising graphics to capture the viewer's attention, which I assisted in doing such with some content creators who had a presence on social media platforms - this led to them growing their platform even more than they imagined due to their viewers maintaining retention. After that, I went on to create several birthday covers for my friends' celebrations and some cover art for one of my friends in the music industry. Since then, I thought "why not turn this into another source of income?". After creating the cover art for my friend & posting it, the reception I received was great and soon enough, clients were coming to me to create stuff for them, which was overwhelming, as well as nerve wrecking.

              <strong>6 Graphics Design wasn't the original name</strong> It started off with being "MotionPhix" as I was also trying to focus on animated graphics - which eventually I thought to leave that for later down the line in my business. Some years have gone by & 6 Graphics Design came about, after several attempts of a rebrand. I went with 6 GD in the end because I didn't want potential clients to see my name and think that I only focused on Motion graphics, as I had plans of branching out further down the line. The 6 really just resignates with me heavily, from my birthday month, to the previous house I stayed in, where the best things in my life happened. Once 6GD was in motion, I've worked on some more cover art for artists, created some flyers - one for a movie premiere, the others were for party events or social groups - which were out of my comfort zone but backing down was not an option. I've also had the pleasure to branch out to video editing too, helping out an artist edit their studio session and their Behind The Scenes to one fo their singles that was released. Partaking in such projects, along with constant talks with those around me, it gave me the confidence in my craft that I needed, they reminded me that I should believe in my craft more than anyone, which pushed me to reach out to people who needed my services or could potentially expand my expertise.

              <strong>I have big aspirations for my business.</strong> In the next upcoming years, I'm hoping to make an entrance in the music scene and create flyers, posters, cover art and all sorts for artists that are in my playlist - which <strong>MAY</strong> currently be in the works, who knows. In regards to services, It's only right for me to start working on short form content, as well as long form content editing for content creators as they work hand in hand depending on the content being edited. For exapmple, for creators who have vlogs and long form videos to post, they'll need someone to pick out the best bits to turn into promotion for them to post before the release. Another thing I'm hoping to happen personally is the improvement of artwork - I think individuals who can create sketches of people by eye have a great talent, which is something I'd love to deveop, which would take business on another level. My main battle right now is marketing - even though your work speaks for you, creating content for people to watch how you create your artwork is also a necessity. I see it as my artwork is my report and all videos of BTS that I post are my references - this pretty much shows people you know your stuff or they can try understand why you went for such approach.

Some artwork require some thought process before i begin, and others I can start and change things along the way. For example, one of my recent work was to create a cover art for a soundcloud mix a DJ was releasing, and included some artist within the same genre. So the first thing would be to find out <strong>WHAT</strong> message or feeling is the mix trying to make people feel like - this then helps with the overall look of the design, whether it gives more of a jumpy vibe, romantic vibe, or more of a gloomy vibe. From there, the images that are included in the artwork would have to reflect or match the mood that you set - meaning that you'll need to find iamges that closely match the bcakground, then try match the image to the surroundings to make it seem as it belongs.<BR><BR>Some of the marketing strategies that I use, predominantly on TikTok, I showcase a slides, step by step on how I go about creating the art, but leaving out the end result. This way I can redirect the viewer to go to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/6.graphicsdesign/" target="_blank" id="instagramlink">Instagram</a> to iew the finished product.<br><br>Finally, my inspiration comes from everywhere I go - everything I see can be used as inspiration, so is the sounds you hear on a daily basis. It's down to the individual to allow creativity to florish from what they see!
